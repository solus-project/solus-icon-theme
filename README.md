# Solus Icon Theme

Solus is the official icon set of the [Solus Project](https://solus-project.com/). As a FreeDesktop icon theme it (loosely) follows the [Tango Icon Spec](http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Icon_Theme_Guidelines).

These icons are licensed openly under the terms of a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0](COPYING) license.

## Not a Universal Icon Set
Since this set is designed specifically for Solus pull requests to add icons or symlinks that are specific to other desktop environments or are for third-party applications will be rejected.

Use of icon names in line with the [FreeDesktop.Org Icon Naming Specification](http://standards.freedesktop.org/icon-naming-spec/icon-naming-spec-latest.html) is encouraged.

## Third-Party Brand Preservation
Solus icons will not supply icons for third-party apps. Pull requests to add icons or symbolic links that would overwrite the branding of third-party apps will be rejected.
